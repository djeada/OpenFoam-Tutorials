## 1. What Is CFD and Why Does It Matter?

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical
methods, algorithms, and computers to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows.
Instead of building expensive physical prototypes or running wind-tunnel experiments for
every design iteration, engineers can simulate fluid behavior digitally — predicting
pressures, velocities, temperatures, and forces with remarkable accuracy.

### Where CFD Is Used

| Industry       | Application Examples                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aerospace**  | Wing design, turbine blade cooling, re-entry heating              |
| **Automotive** | External aerodynamics, engine cooling, HVAC cabin comfort         |
| **Energy**     | Wind turbine siting, nuclear reactor cooling, combustion modeling  |
| **Biomedical** | Blood flow in arteries, drug delivery, respiratory airflow        |
| **Marine**     | Hull resistance, propeller cavitation, wave loading               |
| **Civil Eng.** | Building wind loads, pollution dispersion, ventilation design      |
| **Electronics**| Chip thermal management, data center cooling                      |

### A Brief History

- **1920s–1940s:** Lewis Fry Richardson attempted the first numerical weather prediction
  by hand — dividing the atmosphere into cells and solving balance equations.
- **1960s:** With the arrival of digital computers, researchers at Los Alamos and NASA
  developed the first practical CFD codes (MAC method, SIMPLE algorithm).
- **1980s–1990s:** Commercial CFD software emerged (Fluent, CFX, STAR-CD). Turbulence
  modeling matured ($k$-$\varepsilon$, $k$-$\omega$ SST).
- **2004:** OpenFOAM was released as open-source, democratizing CFD for researchers and
  students worldwide.
- **Today:** GPU-accelerated solvers, machine-learning-augmented turbulence models, and
  cloud-based HPC make CFD faster and more accessible than ever.

### CFD vs Other Approaches

Engineers have three fundamental ways to study fluid flow. Each has a role, and the best
engineering practice combines them.

| Approach | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Analytical** | Derive closed-form solutions from governing equations (e.g., Hagen-Poiseuille pipe flow, Blasius boundary layer). | Exact, instant, deep physical insight. | Only works for highly simplified geometries and assumptions (steady, laminar, simple shapes). Very few real problems have analytical solutions. |
| **Experimental** | Build physical models and measure flow quantities in wind tunnels, water channels, or test rigs. | Captures real physics including turbulence, transition, and complex interactions. Provides ground truth for validation. | Expensive, time-consuming, limited measurement resolution, scaling issues (Reynolds number matching), safety constraints (e.g., nuclear, biomedical). |
| **CFD (Numerical)** | Discretize governing equations on a computational mesh and solve them iteratively on a computer. | Any geometry, any flow regime, full-field data (pressure, velocity, temperature everywhere), cheap parameter sweeps, safe to study dangerous conditions. | Results are only as good as the model (turbulence closure, mesh resolution), requires validation, demands expertise. |

```

**When to prefer CFD over experiments:**
- Early design stages when no prototype exists yet
- Parameter sweeps (e.g., testing 50 angles of attack vs. 5 in a wind tunnel)
- Hazardous or inaccessible environments (nuclear reactors, human arteries)
- When you need full-field data (not just point measurements)

**When experiments are still essential:**
- Validating your CFD model (you cannot trust a simulation that has never been checked)
- Turbulence transition and complex multiphase phenomena that models approximate poorly
- Regulatory certification (e.g., aerospace, automotive crash testing)

## 3. Governing Equations

All of CFD rests on three conservation laws from classical physics. These are partial
differential equations (PDEs) that describe how mass, momentum, and energy are
transported through a fluid.

### 3.1 The Control Volume Concept

Before writing equations, we need to understand what we are writing them *for*. In CFD,
we consider a small fixed region of space — a **control volume** — and track what flows
in and out of it:

```plaintext
                    ┌─── mass flux in (top) ───┐
                    │     ṁ_top = ρ u · n A    │
                    ▼                           │
         ┌──────────────────────────┐           │

  mass   │                          │   mass    │
  flux ──▶   CONTROL VOLUME (CV)    ├──▶ flux   │
  in     │                          │   out     │
 (left)  │   • density ρ           │  (right)  │
         │   • velocity u          │           │
         │   • pressure p          │           │
         │   • energy e            │           │
         │                          │           │
         └──────────────────────────┘           │
                    │                           │
                    │     ṁ_bot = ρ u · n A    │
                    ▼                           │
                    └─── mass flux out (bot) ───┘

  The fundamental idea: Rate of change inside CV =
      (What flows IN) − (What flows OUT) + (Sources)
```

This is the **Reynolds Transport Theorem** in action. Every governing equation in CFD
has this structure: *accumulation = flux in − flux out + sources*.

### 3.2 Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)

**Physical meaning:** Mass cannot be created or destroyed. If fluid enters a region,
it must either accumulate there or leave somewhere else.

**General (compressible) form:**

$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0$$

where $\rho$ is density, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, and
$\nabla \cdot$ is the divergence operator.

**Incompressible simplification:** When density is constant ($\rho = \text{const}$),
the equation reduces to:

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$$

This says that the velocity field must be **divergence-free** — fluid cannot pile up
or thin out anywhere.

> **📂 Repo reference:** In our lid-driven cavity project
> (`projects/01_lid_driven_cavity/`), `icoFoam` assumes incompressible flow, so it
> enforces $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$ at every time step.

### 3.3 Conservation of Momentum (Navier-Stokes Equations)

**Physical meaning:** Newton's second law applied to a fluid element — the rate of
change of momentum equals the sum of all forces (pressure, viscous, gravity).

**General (compressible) form:**

$$\frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \rho \mathbf{g}$$

where $p$ is pressure, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor, and
$\mathbf{g}$ is gravitational acceleration.

**Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations** (constant $\rho$, Newtonian fluid):

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}$$

where $\nu = \mu / \rho$ is the kinematic viscosity.

> **💡 Key insight:** The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are what `icoFoam`
> solves. The left side captures how fluid accelerates (locally in time and by being
> carried along — *convection*). The right side captures the forces: pressure gradient
> pushing the fluid, viscous diffusion smoothing out velocity gradients, and gravity.

### 3.4 Conservation of Energy

**Physical meaning:** Energy is conserved — the rate of change of energy inside a
control volume equals the net heat and work transfer.

$$\frac{\partial (\rho e)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho e \mathbf{u}) = -p \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau}) + \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{g} + Q$$

where $e$ is specific internal energy and $Q$ is a volumetric heat source.

> **Note:** For the incompressible, isothermal flows in most of our tutorial projects,
> the energy equation is not solved — temperature is assumed constant. Solvers like
> `buoyantSimpleFoam` add the energy equation when thermal effects matter.

### 3.5 Turbulence and the Closure Problem

When flow becomes turbulent (high Reynolds number), the Navier-Stokes equations are
still valid, but resolving every tiny eddy is computationally prohibitive. The
**Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)** approach decomposes each variable into a
mean and a fluctuating part, then time-averages. This introduces unknown
**Reynolds stress** terms that require a *turbulence model* to close the system.

Common turbulence models (see note 06 for details):

| Model      | Type    | Best For                                    |
|------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| $k$-$\varepsilon$        | RANS    | General industrial flows, free-shear layers |
| $k$-$\omega$ SST    | RANS    | Boundary layers, adverse pressure gradients  |
| Spalart-Allmaras | RANS | Aerospace external flows                |
| LES        | Scale-resolving | Unsteady flows needing eddy resolution |

> **📂 Repo reference:** The NACA airfoil project (`projects/04_naca_airfoil_analysis/`)
> uses the $k$-$\varepsilon$ turbulence model with `simpleFoam`, while the lid-driven cavity
> (`projects/01_lid_driven_cavity/`) is solved as laminar.

## 4. Discretization — From Calculus to Algebra

The governing equations are continuous PDEs — they apply at every point in space and
every instant in time. Computers cannot solve continuous equations directly. We must
**discretize**: convert the continuous domain into a finite set of cells and convert the
PDEs into algebraic equations that can be solved with linear algebra.

### 4.4 From PDE to Linear System

The discretization process converts a PDE like:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \phi) = \Gamma \nabla^2 \phi$$

into a system of algebraic equations, one per cell:

$$a_P \phi_P = \sum_{N} a_N \phi_N + b_P$$

where $\phi_P$ is the value at cell $P$, $\phi_N$ are values at neighboring cells, and
$a_P$, $a_N$, $b_P$ are coefficients that come from the discretization. Assembled over
all cells, this becomes a matrix equation:

$$\mathbf{A} \boldsymbol{\phi} = \mathbf{b}$$

This sparse linear system is what the linear solvers (PCG, smoothSolver, GAMG —
see note 09) actually solve at every iteration or time step.

## 5. The Finite Volume Method in Detail

Since OpenFOAM is built entirely on FVM, it is worth understanding how this method works
in more depth.

### 5.1 Integral Form and Gauss's Divergence Theorem

Starting from the general transport equation in differential form:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \phi) = \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla \phi) + S$$

We integrate over a control volume $V$ bounded by surface $\partial V$:

$$\int_V \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \, dV + \int_V \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \phi) \, dV = \int_V \nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla \phi) \, dV + \int_V S \, dV$$

Applying **Gauss's Divergence Theorem** ($\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV = \oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA$), the volume integrals of divergence terms become surface integrals:

$$\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \phi \, dV + \oint_{\partial V} (\mathbf{u} \phi) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \oint_{\partial V} (\Gamma \nabla \phi) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA + \int_V S \, dV$$

### 5.2 Cell-Centered vs Vertex-Centered

| Approach | Where values are stored | Used by |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Cell-centered** | At the centroid of each cell | **OpenFOAM**, Fluent, STAR-CCM+ |
| Vertex-centered | At the vertices (corners) of each cell | SU2, some FEM-based codes |

OpenFOAM stores all field values (p, U, k, $\varepsilon$, etc.) at cell centers. When fluxes are
needed at faces, values are **interpolated** from the cell centers to the face using
interpolation schemes (linear, upwind, etc.).

### 5.3 Discrete Operators in OpenFOAM

OpenFOAM's `fvm::` and `fvc::` namespaces map directly to the FVM discretization:

| Operator             | Continuous          | OpenFOAM Code                  |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Time derivative      | $\partial/\partial t$ | `fvm::ddt(U)`                |
| Convection           | $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}\phi)$ | `fvm::div(phi, U)` |
| Diffusion (Laplacian)| $\nabla^2 \phi$     | `fvm::laplacian(nu, U)`       |
| Gradient             | $\nabla p$          | `fvc::grad(p)`                |

### 6.2 Spatial Discretization (Convection Schemes)

The convection term $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \phi)$ is the trickiest to discretize
because it can introduce numerical oscillations (wiggles) or excessive smearing
(artificial diffusion).

### 6.3 Gradient Schemes

Gradients are needed for pressure gradient evaluation and for reconstructing face
values in higher-order convection schemes. Common choices:

- `Gauss linear` — compute the gradient using Gauss's theorem with linear interpolation
  to faces. This is the most common default.
- `cellLimited Gauss linear 1` — same, but limit the gradient so that reconstructed
  face values do not exceed/undershoot cell neighbor values. Prevents oscillations.

### 6.4 Laplacian (Diffusion) Schemes

The diffusion term $\nabla \cdot (\Gamma \nabla \phi)$ is discretized as:

$$\sum_f \Gamma_f (\nabla \phi)_f \cdot \mathbf{S}_f$$

In OpenFOAM: `Gauss linear corrected` — linear interpolation of $\Gamma$ to the face,
with a non-orthogonal correction for meshes whose face normals are not aligned with the
vector between cell centers.

> **⚠️ Warning:** On highly non-orthogonal meshes (angle > 70°), you may need
> `nNonOrthogonalCorrectors` > 0 in `fvSolution` to get accurate diffusion terms.

## 7. Pressure-Velocity Coupling

### 7.1 The Problem

In incompressible flow, there is no explicit equation for pressure — the continuity
equation $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$ acts as a *constraint* on the velocity field.
The momentum equation gives us velocity, but it contains the pressure gradient. We need
a way to couple pressure and velocity so both the momentum equation and the continuity
constraint are satisfied simultaneously.

## 8. Convergence and Accuracy

### 8.1 Residuals — How We Know the Solution Is Converging

At each iteration (or time step), the linear solver reduces the **residual** — the
imbalance in the discretized equation $\mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\phi} = \mathbf{b}$.
The initial residual is:

$$r = ||\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\phi}||$$

As the solver iterates, this should decrease. OpenFOAM prints residuals every iteration:

```
Time = 0.5
smoothSolver:  Solving for Ux, Initial residual = 3.2e-04, Final residual = 1.1e-06, No Iterations 4
smoothSolver:  Solving for Uy, Initial residual = 2.8e-04, Final residual = 9.3e-07, No Iterations 4
PCG:           Solving for p,  Initial residual = 5.1e-03, Final residual = 2.4e-06, No Iterations 12
```

**Rules of thumb:**
- Initial residuals dropping below ~$10^{-4}$ for velocity and ~$10^{-3}$ for pressure
  typically indicates decent convergence for SIMPLE-based steady solvers.
- For transient solvers (PISO/PIMPLE), the *final* residual at each time step should be
  below the specified `tolerance` (e.g., $10^{-6}$).

### 8.2 Grid Independence

A CFD result is only meaningful if it does not change significantly when the mesh is
refined. A **grid independence study** (or mesh convergence study) works as follows:

1. Run the simulation on a coarse mesh.
2. Refine the mesh (double the resolution in each direction).
3. Compare a key quantity (drag coefficient, pressure drop, etc.).
4. If the quantity changes by less than ~1–2%, the coarser mesh is sufficient.

> **💡 Tip:** Always report grid independence in academic work. A beautiful CFD picture
> on a coarse mesh can be completely wrong!

### 8.3 The CFL Number

The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number constrains the time step relative to the mesh
and flow velocity:

$$\text{CFL} = \frac{u \, \Delta t}{\Delta x}$$

where $u$ is the local velocity, $\Delta t$ is the time step, and $\Delta x$ is the
local cell size.

- **Explicit schemes:** require $\text{CFL} < 1$ for stability (information must not travel more
  than one cell per time step).
- **Implicit schemes:** unconditionally stable in theory, but accuracy degrades for
  $\text{CFL} \gg 1$.

> **📖 See also:** Note 08 (`notes/08_cfl_number.md`) provides an in-depth treatment
> of the CFL number, including practical guidelines for choosing time steps in OpenFOAM.

### 8.4 Sources of Error in CFD

| Error Type | Description | How to Minimize |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Modeling error** | Wrong physics (e.g., laminar model for turbulent flow) | Choose appropriate models |
| **Discretization error** | Truncation from finite mesh/time step | Refine mesh and time step |
| **Iterative error** | Solver not fully converged | Tighten tolerances, more iterations |
| **Round-off error** | Finite precision of floating-point arithmetic | Usually negligible (use double precision) |
| **Input error** | Wrong boundary conditions, geometry, or properties | Careful setup and validation |

## 9. OpenFOAM in the CFD Landscape

### 9.1 Comparison with Commercial Solvers

| Feature | OpenFOAM | ANSYS Fluent | Siemens STAR-CCM+ |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | Free (GPL) | $$$$ (tens of thousands/year) | $$$$ |
| **Source code** | Fully open ✔ | Closed | Closed |
| **Customization** | Unlimited (C++) | Limited (UDFs) | Limited (Java macros) |
| **GUI** | Minimal (ParaView for post) | Integrated GUI | Integrated GUI |
| **Learning curve** | Steep | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Meshing** | blockMesh, snappyHexMesh | Fluent Meshing, ICEM | Built-in polyhedral mesher |
| **Parallelization** | Built-in (OpenMPI) ✔ | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Community** | Large, active ✔ | Vendor support | Vendor support |
| **Industry adoption** | Growing (automotive, energy) | Dominant | Strong (automotive) |

### 9.2 Why Open-Source Matters

- **Transparency:** You can read every line of the solver. If it gives a wrong answer,
  you can find out *why* at the source-code level.
- **Reproducibility:** Anyone can run your exact simulation without purchasing a license.
  This is critical for academic publications.
- **Customization:** Need a custom boundary condition, a new turbulence model, or a
  coupled multi-physics solver? Write it in C++ and compile.
- **Cost:** Running 1000-core HPC jobs? No per-core license fees.

### 9.3 OpenFOAM's Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive solver library (incompressible, compressible, multiphase, combustion,
  electromagnetics, solid mechanics).
- Flexible meshing with `snappyHexMesh` for complex geometries.
- Mature parallelization with domain decomposition.
- Extensive turbulence model library.

**Limitations:**
- No integrated GUI — everything is done through text dictionaries and the command line.
- Steep learning curve for beginners (which is why this repo exists!).
- Documentation can be sparse for advanced features.
- Two main forks (openfoam.org and openfoam.com) can cause confusion.

## 10. Quick Reference — Key Takeaways

> **📋 SUMMARY BOX**
>
> 1. **CFD** solves fluid flow problems numerically by discretizing the governing PDEs
>    into algebraic equations on a mesh.
>
> 2. **Three conservation laws** govern all fluid flow: mass (continuity), momentum
>    (Navier-Stokes), and energy.
>
> 3. **Incompressible Navier-Stokes** ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$ and the momentum
>    equation with $\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}$) are what `icoFoam` solves.
>
> 4. **The Finite Volume Method** converts PDEs into integral form over control volumes,
>    naturally conserving transported quantities.
>
> 5. **Numerical schemes** trade off accuracy vs. stability: upwind is stable but
>    diffusive; central differencing is accurate but can oscillate.
>
> 6. **Pressure-velocity coupling** algorithms (SIMPLE, PISO, PIMPLE) are needed
>    because there is no explicit pressure equation in incompressible flow.
>
> 7. **Always validate** your results: check residuals, perform grid independence
>    studies, and compare with analytical/experimental data.
>
> 8. **OpenFOAM** is a powerful open-source FVM-based CFD toolbox — free, customizable,
>    and widely used in both academia and industry.
